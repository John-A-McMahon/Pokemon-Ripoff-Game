# Pokemon-Ripoff-Game
This is a class project where I had to make a turn based pokemon-esque clone
THere is no movement, only a battle

features:
You can save/load your game
You can pick your class
You can name your teamates

just use gcc to compile and ./a.out to run! Nice and simple!

I added some pop culture references in the code.



HAVE FUN!
